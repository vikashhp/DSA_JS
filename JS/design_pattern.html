Design pattern problem - How will you design a Student class which stores the name , age , phone number, board marks of each student. Complete the constructor to initialize the values.
Complete the function eligible to check whether the student is eligible or not for college. If board marks > 40 -> eligible , if less than 40 -> not eligible.
Complete the function increaseStudentCount which keep track of the number of students created. Have you heard of static variables. Leverage that now. Check Hints 1 if you are stuck.
